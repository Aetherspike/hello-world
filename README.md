# hello-world
Created for assessment for entry into Code:Kentucky.
My name is Chris. I have driven semi-trucks over the road for 8 years, and I am sick of being away from home. My favorite hobby is videogames, and ever since I was a teenager I've been curious about coding, but like any connoisseur, I was hesitant about learning how the sausage is made. I am ready to forsake the magic of my pasttime and enter into a field of work that will improve the lives of me and my family.
